 * [How to Provision NetIDs and JoinEUIs in the DNS for OTAA and Roaming?]

## Why the DNS infrastructure is required in the LoRaWAN set up?

As per the LoRaWAN Backend specifications, the DNS infrastructure is used for the following operations:

1.	OTAA: By the NS to get the IP address of the Join Server
2.  Roaming: By the vNS (Visited NS) to find the hNS (Home NS)
3.  OTAA: Associate a batch of devices to one specific Join Server using a DNS look-up, combining DevEUI and JoinEUI

Two types of identifiers are provisioned in the DNS - 1. NetIDS for Roaming and 2. JoinEUI for OTAA. as per the backend specification, the LoRa Alliance DNS tree is as shown in the below figure:

## How to Provision NetIDs and JoinEUIs in the DNS for OTAA and Roaming?

As of now, the LoRa DNS service is not operational. Hence, for the Academic LoRaWAN roaming purposes we have a separate zone called ```iotreg.net``` where the NetIDs and JoinEUIs could be provisioned as shown in the figure below:

</p>

To provision the information in the DNS (Currently only the JoinEUI info), Send your JoinEUI information (i.e. the Join EUI and the corresponding JS domain name or IP address) to  sandoche.balakrichenan@afnic.fr AND antoine.bernard@afnic.fr 
 
## Verify that your JoinEUI and NetID is publicly accessible

Once the JoinEUI information is updated to the DNS, one can verify whether the information is updated properly by reversing the JoinEUI, delimiting by ‘.’ and adding the suffix “joineuis.iotreg.net” and testing using the ```dig``` utility as shown inthe figure:
